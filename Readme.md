# Solitaire

## Goals:

Implement a solitaire framework that could support a variety of different games.The current
structure supports tableau-and-goal style games, and implemented are

* Klondike
* Canfield
* Free Cell
* Spider

Games that have a more unusual layout, like [Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(solitaire\)),
would probably require new data structure(s) to support.

## What's missing/to do:

* Cheat functions could be better
* animate drag undo
* implement Windows-style card moves in Free Cell?
* CardStackPanel height should be dynamic based on how many cards it contains
* Dragging is kinda broken when you click down on an unddraggable spot and then drag
  over a draggable stack
