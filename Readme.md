# Solitaire

## Goals:

Implement a solitaire framework that could support a variety of different games.The current
structure was designed with tableau-and-goal style games in mind, although games with
a different structure (like [Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(solitaire\))) can be implemented too.

* Klondike
* Canfield
* Free Cell
* Spider
* Pyramid

## What's missing/to do:

* animate drag undo
* Cheat functions could be better
* implement Windows-style card moves in Free Cell?
* comments, code review, cleanup
* should do lazy initialization of games, especially if more are implemented
